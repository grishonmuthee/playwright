# Daily Progress Log – January 13, 2026

**Project**: Browser Automation & Bot Detection Evasion Research  
**Environment**: Ubuntu Linux ( 24.04+), Python 3.12 virtual environment (`headlessbot-env`)

## Summary of Activities

- **Selenium troubleshooting & stabilization**  
  - Diagnosed and resolved "Chrome instance exited" / "SessionNotCreatedException" errors commonly seen on Ubuntu when running headless Chrome via Selenium.  
  - Installed comprehensive system dependencies (including time_t64 variants: `libasound2t64`, `libatk-bridge2.0-0t64`, etc.) to support headless rendering and sandboxing.  
  - Applied essential launch flags: `--no-sandbox`, `--disable-dev-shm-usage`, `--disable-gpu`, `--window-size=1920,1080`.  
  - Successfully executed basic Google search automation script and implemented extraction of organic search results (title, URL, snippet).

- **Playwright evaluation**  
  - Installed and explored Playwright (synchronous API) as a modern alternative to Selenium.  
  - Tested core features: auto-waiting, robust locators, full-page screenshots, and human-like behavior simulation (mouse movement, scrolling, keyboard inputs).  
  - Created proof-of-concept scripts to:
    - Navigate to YouTube, attempt video playback (Rick Astley example) with activity nudges to prevent auto-pause.
    - Capture screenshots of bot detection test pages.

- **SeleniumBase & Pure CDP Mode experimentation**  
  - Installed SeleniumBase and tested **Pure CDP mode** (`sb_cdp.Chrome()`) for stealthier automation (no WebDriver footprint).  
  - Resolved startup issues: missing `tkinter` (`python3-tk`), library dependencies, incorrect cleanup method (`.quit()` vs `.close()`).  
  - Attempted full-page screenshots of CreepJS (https://abrahamjuliot.github.io/creepjs/) → identified API limitation (`full_page` not supported in CDP mode).  
  - Implemented manual full-page capture workaround via JavaScript scroll height detection and window resizing.

- **Bot detection & evasion testing**  
  - Evaluated multiple public bot/headless detection test sites:
    - CreepJS (abrahamjuliot.github.io/creepjs)
    - Bot.sannysoft.com
    - Browserscan.net
    - Pixelscan.net
    - Bot.incolumitas.com
  - Observed common detection vectors: CDP leaks, `navigator.webdriver`, canvas/WebGL inconsistencies, behavioral anomalies, plugin tampering signals.  
  - Applied basic evasion techniques: user-agent spoofing, blink feature disable, no-sandbox mode. Noted that advanced tests (especially CreepJS) frequently flag known automation tools even in headed mode.

- **Screenshot automation**  
  - Developed scripts to capture screenshots of bot detection pages using Selenium, Playwright, and SeleniumBase CDP mode.  
  - Explored full-page capture techniques: manual window resizing (Selenium/SeleniumBase), native `full_page=True` (Playwright).  
  - Documented limitations in SeleniumBase CDP mode for full-page screenshots and identified workarounds.

## Key Learnings

- Headless Chrome on Linux requires explicit dependency installation (especially t64 transitions on Ubuntu 24.04+).
- Pure CDP mode in SeleniumBase offers strong stealth potential but has a different API surface (no `.cdp.` namespace, `.quit()` for cleanup).
- Playwright generally provides better reliability and native full-page screenshot support compared to Selenium/SeleniumBase for visual capture tasks.
- No single stealth method fully evades CreepJS-level detection; combining headed mode, real Chrome binary, behavioral simulation, and residential proxies is likely required for high trust scores.

## Next Steps

- Achieve consistent full-page screenshots across tools (prioritize Playwright native support).
- Integrate residential proxy rotation to improve bot scores on CreepJS and similar platforms.
- Evaluate advanced evasion forks (Patchright, rebrowser-playwright) for deeper CDP leak mitigation.
- Organize all working scripts into repo folders with READMEs and commit today's progress.
